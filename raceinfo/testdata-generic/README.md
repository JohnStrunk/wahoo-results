# Generic file sharing test data

This directory contains test data for the "Generic Network File Sharing"
result format. This file format is used by several different timing systems,
including the Colorado Time Systems Gen7.

The format is described in the [PDF
file](./Swim%20File%20Sharing%20of%20Results%20format.pdf) in this directory.
The contents of the file were originally obtained from the [Active Hy-Tek web
site](https://support.activenetwork.com/hytekswimming/articles/en_US/Article/Format-for-Generic-File-Sharing-of-Results-Swimming).
