# Welcome to the new site

As people get older, sometimes they decide to “have some work done.” It was that
time for the Wahoo! Results documentation site.

<!-- more -->

The old site was (mostly) usable, but it lacked a certain amount of polish. It
was built using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) with the Read
The Docs theme. It is a great documentation system, but the theme is a bit
dated, and writing the documentation in
[reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) is a bit tedious. I
was also interested in making it look better on mobile devices.

As a result, I decided to switch the documentation over to the well-designed
[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
documentation system. This allows the documentation to be written in Markdown
(via [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)), and where special formatting is needed,
html and css can be used directly.

In the process, I also switched over to a custom domain, so
[https://wahoo-results.com](https://wahoo-results.com) is the new home for the
documentation! The old
[https://wahoo-results.readthedocs.io](https://wahoo-results.readthedocs.io)
will redirect for now, but remember to update your bookmarks.
