# Wahoo! Results

{{ WR }} is a free swimming scoreboard that you can use to display race results
at your meets. It combines start list data from your meet management software
(e.g., {{ HMM }} or {{ SMM }}) with data files from a {{ CD }} to produce an
attractive scoreboard that keeps swimmers, coaches, and spectators informed of
race results in real-time.

The scoreboard is transmitted to Chromecast devices, allowing the results to be
available on many displays at your facility.
