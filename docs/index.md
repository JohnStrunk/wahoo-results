# Wahoo! Results

![Example scoreboard](images/demo1.png){ width=1280 height=720 .rfloat }

{{ WR }} is a free swimming scoreboard to display race results at your meets. It
combines start list data from your meet management software (e.g., {{ HMM }} or
{{ SMM }}) with timing data from a {{ CD }} to produce an attractive scoreboard
that keeps swimmers, coaches, and spectators informed of race results in
real-time.

The scoreboard is transmitted to Chromecast devices, allowing the results to be
available on many displays at your facility.
