Wahoo! Results is a free swimming scoreboard that you can use to display race
results at your meets. It combines start list data from your meet management
software (e.g., HyTek Meet Manager) with data files from a Colorado Dolphin
timing system to produce an attractive scoreboard that keeps swimmers,
coaches, and spectators informed of race results in real-time.
