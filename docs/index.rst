|wr| is a free swimming scoreboard that you can use to display race results at
your meets. It combines start list data from your meet management software
(e.g., |HMM|_ or |SMM|_) with data files from a
Colorado Dolphin timing system to produce an attractive scoreboard that keeps
swimmers, coaches, and spectators informed of race results in real-time.

The scoreboard is transmitted to Chromecast devices, allowing the results to
be available on many displays at your facility.
