**Enjoying the scoreboard? [Add your team to the list of users!](in-action.md)**

The scoreboard is packaged as a single executable, and no installation is
necessary. The above executable is all you need to get started.

User preferences are saved in a `wahoo-results.ini` file in the same directory
as the executable. If it doesn't exist, it will be created when the program is
first run.
