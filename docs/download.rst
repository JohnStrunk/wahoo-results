   Version 0.4.0 - 04/24/2021 - `wahoo-results.zip
   <https://github.com/JohnStrunk/wahoo-results/releases/download/v0.4.0/wahoo-results.zip>`_

The scoreboard is packaged as a single executable, and no installation is
necessary. The above executable is all you need to get started.

User preferences are saved in a ``wahoo-results.ini`` file in the same
directory as the executable. If it doesn't exist, it will be created when the
program is first run.
